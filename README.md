I tend to let my friends borrow money and decided to keep track of each transaction with some sort of app. 
At first, I was messing around. I had the intentions to make an app out of it, but first I had to play around with the libraries.

# How to
This application looks for a saving directory. You can open previous saves if you have a location for them.
The saved files for each client is a .txt file.
The .txt file must be named by the person's name and its content should like this below:
'''
+123.23
-124.21
-125.23
+126.64
'''
'+' means they are borrowing money
'-' means they are paying that borrowed money off
